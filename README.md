## SimpleTest unit testing module for Kohana

This is a module for the [Kohana PHP framework](http://kohanaphp.com/) that
integrates [SimpleTest](http://www.simpletest.org/).

Release 0.1.1 for Kohana 3

### Quick Start

* Download and unpack the module, put it in your modules directory and enable
  it in your bootstrap file.
* Go to <your_url>/simpletest to see a (really ugly) welcome page with a link
  to a (slightly prettier) demo page.
* Create your own tests in a directory 'simpletests' in your application
  directory.
* Use the link on the welcome page to run your tests.
* That's it! No PEAR, no command line, just Simple Unit Testing. Oh and there's
  an excellent remote web test suite and a few other goodies thrown in...
